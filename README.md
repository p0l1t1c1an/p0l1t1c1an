# Howdy! 

I'm Jacob Boicken, a Cybersecurity Engineer Studying at Iowa State University. 

I am currently stuck behind a CGNAT setup in my apartment, so you'll be having a hard time reaching me.

### About Me
- **Currently**: I'm a security student by day and a programmer turned homelab enthusiast by night.

- **Coding**: I love to program in Rust, C, or Python. I reluctantly work in Java but want to replace that with Kotlin.

- **OS**: Mainly, I use the BSD family, but I also run a hardened Arch Linux set up and have been learning Illumos. 

- **Music**: I am a variety pack of music. Name a genre and I listen to. From classic rock to dubstep to R&B.     

- **Career**: A few fields look really interesting to me: Threat Hunting, Incident Response, and DevSecOps/AppSec.
    - Hoping to start as a jr security analyst and move up to actionable roles w/ TH or IR. 
    - As well, starting in DevOps position then moving to DevSecOps/AppSec.

### Projects I am Working On
- **HomeServer**: Setting up my own SmastOS/Illumos server to run VM/containers and documenting along the way.

- **C-utils**: Writing Objects In C! So I don't have to keep reinventing the wheel in every C project. 

- **WebServer**: Porting my github.io website to a Rust web server that I will be building when I get around to it.
    - On hold as my current apartment doesn't provide me with an IPv6 address
