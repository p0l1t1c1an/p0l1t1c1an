# Howdy! 

My name is Jacob Boicken. I'm a cybersecurity engineer studying at Iowa State.
I love to work on my server and read security, history, ethics, and pyschology books.
I enjoy programming in **Rust** and C/C++ and have been force into Java for schoolwork.
I am a big fan **OpenBSD** & FreeBSD, but I have also been enjoying NoSystemd Linux Distros like Void, Devuan, & Artix.
Love classic rock (& a little country) from the 50s, 60s, & 70s, punk/alt rock from 90s & 2000s, and a TON of video game music.
