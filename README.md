# Howdy! 

I'm Jacob Boicken, a Cybersecurity Engineer Studying at Iowa State. 

And I definitely don't use my homelab as a space heater in the winter. 

---

### About Me
- **Currently**: I'm a security intern by day and homelab enthusiast by night.

- **Coding**: I love to program on my own time in Rust, C, or Python. But I don't want to live development hell ever!

- **OS**: On the daily, I use BSD family OSes, but I have also been enjoying NoSystemd Linux distros and Illumos. 

- **Music**: I am a variety pack of music. Name a genre and I listen to. From classic rock to dubstep to R&B.     


---

### Projects I am Working On
- **HomeServer**: Setting up my own SmastOS server to run VM/containers and will be documented along the way.

- **C-utils**: Writing OOB in C! So I don't have to keep reinventing the wheel in every C project. 

- **WebServer**: Porting my github.io website to a Rust web server that I will be building when I get around to it.
