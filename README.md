### About Me

- **Coding**: I love Rust, C, and Python. School taught me \*gag\* Java and somehow I learned C# along the way.

- **OS**: I love the BSD and Linux systems. Run them for my servers, network and endpoints.
    - Containerize everything!

- **Music**: I listen to just about any kind of music. Rock is my favorite child though. 
    - Metal, Acid, Psychedelia, Prog, Folk, Alt, Punk, Indie. All so good!      

- **Career**: I am currently working for Epic Hosting (the EHR company) as a Client Systems Administrator
    - I am basic just a cloud engineering managing the VMs and Applications
