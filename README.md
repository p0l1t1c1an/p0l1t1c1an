# Howdy! 

I'm Jacob Boicken, a Cybersecurity Engineer Studying at Iowa State University. 

I am currently stuck behind a CGNAT setup in my apartment, so you'll be having a hard time reaching me.

### About Me
- **Currently**: I'm a security student by day and a programmer turned homelab enthusiast by night.

- **Coding**: I love to program in Rust, C, or Python. I reluctantly work in Java but want to replace that with Kotlin.

- **OS**: Mainly, I use the BSD family, but I also run a hardened Arch Linux set up and have been learning Illumos. 

- **Music**: I am a rock maniac. Love the Doobie Brothers, ELO, the Kinks, and Buffalo Springfield.    

- **Career**: I want to eventual be a security architech but before that that I need to go through all the roles.
    - Would like to start as an analyst and move to threat hunting and incident response.  
    - Or starting in DevOps/Software position then moving to DevSecOps/AppSec.
    - Then, working as a security engineer with focus in cloud and container security.

### Projects I am Working On
- **HomeLab**: Setting up my own Kubernetes cluster and monitoring it with all through Grafana/Loki.

- **WebServer**: Porting my github.io website to a Rust web server that I will be building when I get around to it.
    - On hold as my current apartment doesn't provide me with an IPv6 address

- **AccumulatedKnowledge**: Wiki.js markdown notes to document everything I have learned through college.
    - Bottom-up approach to hardware, software, and security concepts and seeing how they all connect. 
    - *Not yet started*
